# üåê Commet Service

A modular Docker Compose configuration system for Commet client with support for multiple environments. Commet is a simple and modern Matrix client that provides a clean alternative to Element with fewer dependencies and a streamlined user experience.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Build Configurations

Use the stackbuilder utility to generate deployment configurations:

```bash
sb build
```

This will create all environment combinations in the `build/` directory based on [`stackbuilder.toml`](stackbuilder.toml:1).

### 2. Choose Your Configuration

Navigate to the desired configuration directory:

```bash
# For development with port forwarding
cd build/forwarding/

# For DevContainer environment  
cd build/devcontainer/

# For production with Let's Encrypt SSL
cd build/letsencrypt/

# For production with Step CA SSL
cd build/step-ca/
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Copy and edit the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values
```

### 4. Deploy

Start the services:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Access: `http://localhost:3000` (for forwarding mode)

## üìÅ Directory Structure

- **`components/`** - Source Docker Compose files and configurations
  - `base/` - Base Commet service configuration
  - `environments/` - Environment-specific configurations (devcontainer, forwarding, letsencrypt, step-ca)
  
- **`build/`** - Generated deployment configurations (created by `sb build`)
  - Each subdirectory contains ready-to-deploy Docker Compose files

## üîß Available Environments

- **devcontainer**: Development environment with workspace network
- **forwarding**: Development environment with port forwarding (3000:80)
- **letsencrypt**: Production with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
- **step-ca**: Production with Step CA SSL certificates

## üîß Environment Variables

### Base Configuration

- `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`: Project name for Docker Compose (default: commet)

### Let's Encrypt Configuration

- `VIRTUAL_PORT`: Port for nginx-proxy (default: 80)
- `VIRTUAL_HOST`: Domain for nginx-proxy (e.g., commet.example.com)
- `LETSENCRYPT_HOST`: Domain for SSL certificate
- `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`: Email for certificate registration

### Step CA Configuration

- `VIRTUAL_PORT`: Port for nginx-proxy (default: 80)
- `VIRTUAL_HOST`: Domain for nginx-proxy (e.g., commet.local)
- `LETSENCRYPT_HOST`: Domain for SSL certificate
- `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL`: Email for certificate registration

## üåê Networks

- **Development**: `commet-network` (internal)
- **DevContainer**: `commet-workspace-network` (external)
- **Let's Encrypt**: `letsencrypt-network` (external)
- **Step CA**: `step-ca-network` (external)

## üîí Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Checklist:**

- Configure proper Matrix homeserver URL
- Set up proper firewall rules
- Regular security updates
- Configure rate limiting
- Set up proper logging
- Validate SSL certificates

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Build Issues:**

- Ensure `sb` is installed: <https://github.com/zyrakq/stackbuilder>
- Check [`stackbuilder.toml`](stackbuilder.toml:1) configuration

**Commet Issues:**

- Verify Matrix homeserver connection
- Review container logs: `docker logs commet`
- Check network connectivity

**SSL Issues:**

- **Let's Encrypt**: Verify domain DNS and letsencrypt-manager
- **Step CA**: Check step-ca-manager and virtual network config

**Matrix Connection Issues:**

- Verify Matrix homeserver is accessible
- Check CORS configuration on homeserver
- Validate SSL certificates
- Check network connectivity between Commet and Matrix

## üìù Notes

- The `build/` directory is automatically generated by `sb build` and should not be edited manually
- Environment variables in generated files use `$VARIABLE_NAME` format for proper interpolation
- Each generated configuration includes a complete `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`
- Commet requires proper Matrix homeserver configuration for functionality
